# Background
The problem I was trying to solve was to highlight how Apollo's systems tools can be used to diagnose and debug common installation problems seen on Fire Systems. The issues addressed were identified from this LinkedIn post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/apollo-fire-detectors_we-promised-to-share-our-findings-about-top-activity-6672087993886633984-zLr9/ in which Apollo's end users were invited to vote on the most common issues that they encounter.
