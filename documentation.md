# Background
The problem I was trying to solve was to highlight how Apollo's systems tools can be used to diagnose and debug common installation problems seen on Fire Systems. The issues addressed were identified from this LinkedIn post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/apollo-fire-detectors_we-promised-to-share-our-findings-about-top-activity-6672087993886633984-zLr9/ in which Apollo's end users were invited to vote on the most common issues that they encounter.

# Wireframes
These can be found in: https://github.com/Grahame-student/CDA404_AE2_work_based_project/tree/master/docs/wireframes

**Main troubleshooting page**
This is what I would consider my main page as it puts the rest of the pages into context.

The wireframe shows the key features of the Apollo website's common header and footer that are required to make the new page look correct. 
From this page there will be a link to each of the individual fault pages, which give a bit more detail on which Apollo products can help improve the fault finding experience.
I believe that were this integrated into the Apollo website, it would be linked to from the Training and Support page: https://www.apollo-fire.co.uk/training-and-support
